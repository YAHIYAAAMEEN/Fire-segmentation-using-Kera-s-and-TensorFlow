Explaination od code step by step. 

 1. Check GPU Availability
   - Command: `!nvidia-smi`
   - Explanation:
     - This command checks the GPU's status, including temperature, power consumption, memory usage, and current processes using the GPU.
     - It's important for confirming that the system's GPU (in this case, Tesla T4) is available for performing the computationally heavy image segmentation tasks efficiently.

 2. Library Imports and TensorFlow Setup
   - Libraries Imported:
     - TensorFlow (`tensorflow as tf`): Core library for building and training machine learning models.
     - Other Libraries:
       - os, glob, random, cv2: Standard libraries for file handling, image processing, and randomization.
       - numpy: Used for array and numerical operations.
       - sklearn: Provides utilities for computing class weights and other preprocessing steps.
       - tqdm: For displaying progress bars during iterations.
       - skimage (io, transform): Utilities from scikit-image for image I/O and transformations.
       - matplotlib: Used for plotting graphs and visualizing images.
       - segmentation_models (`sm`): A specialized library for deep learning-based image segmentation tasks using pre-built architectures like U-Net, FPN, PSPNet, etc.
   
   - Setting the Segmentation Framework:
     - `sm.set_framework('tf.keras')` explicitly sets the segmentation model to use TensorFlow's Keras API, ensuring compatibility for model construction and training.
     - Purpose: By defining the backend framework, you can seamlessly use Keras layers and components to build models.

 3. Mounting Google Drive
   - Command: `drive.mount('/content/drive')`
   - Explanation:
     - This mounts Google Drive to the Colab environment, providing access to datasets or pre-trained models stored in the user's drive.
     - This is commonly used in Colab-based projects to handle data stored in Drive and load it directly into the notebook.

 4. (Potential Missing Steps) Dataset Loading and Preprocessing
   - Although not shown here, typical steps would involve:
     - Reading Images: Loading the dataset using libraries like `skimage.io` or `cv2` for image segmentation tasks.
     - Normalization: Using functions like `normalize()` from `tensorflow.keras` to standardize pixel values (e.g., scaling between 0 and 1).
     - Resizing: Resizing images using `skimage.transform.resize()` to fit the input size required by segmentation models (e.g., 12x12 or 256x256).
     - Splitting the Data: Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

 5. Class Weights Calculation
   - Explanation:
     - In segmentation tasks, the dataset may be imbalanced (e.g., few pixels representing a specific class).
     - Class weights are computed using `sklearn.utils.class_weight` to assign higher importance to underrepresented classes during model training.
     - This ensures that the model does not bias toward the majority class and improves performance on minority class predictions.

 6. Model Selection and Initialization
   - Explanation:
     - The `segmentation_models` library provides a variety of pre-built segmentation architectures like:
       - U-Net: Commonly used for biomedical image segmentation.
       - FPN (Feature Pyramid Network): Useful for detecting objects at multiple scales.
       - PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network): Effective for scene parsing tasks with multi-scale context aggregation.
     - Once the model is chosen (not explicitly seen in the available cells), it is typically compiled with an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., Dice loss or binary cross-entropy).

 7. Model Training and Evaluation
   - Training the Model:
     - The segmentation model is trained using standard functions from Keras such as `model.fit()`.
     - During training, the input image batches are fed through the network, and predictions are generated.
     - Loss and metrics (e.g., accuracy, IoU) are calculated and used to update the weights of the model via backpropagation.

   - Model Evaluation:
     - The model is evaluated on a test set to assess its performance.
     - Metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, or accuracy are calculated to measure how well the model segments the objects of interest.

 . Visualization of Results
   - Explanation:
     - Post-training, results are typically visualized using libraries like `matplotlib.pyplot`, where segmented outputs are plotted alongside the ground truth.
     - These visualizations are important for qualitative analysis, allowing the user to visually inspect how well the model segments various classes in the images.

 Possible Next Steps (Not Present in Code Yet):
   - Model Tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and model architecture for improved performance.
   - Post-Processing: Techniques such as thresholding or morphological operations may be applied to improve the segmentation output.
   - Saving the Model: The trained model is often saved using `model.save()` for future use.
